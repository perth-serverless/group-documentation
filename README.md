# Perth Serverless group documentation

Documentation for [Perth Serverless](http://meetu.ps/c/46Yn6/6jxk/d) meetup group. 

## Group Description

A Perth group for anyone involved in software with an interest in serverless architecture.

We discuss many different topics around serverless and cloud-native software: function as a service (FaaS), cloud providers and services, serverless tools, and how serverless interacts with other modern practices such as devops and agile.

This is a technology-agnostic group that discusses many different cloud services from a range of vendors.

We are open to topic suggestions and speaker nominations.

## Mission Statement
